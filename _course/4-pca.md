# Lecture 4

## 4.0 Lesson learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, we should understand what is principal components analysis and how to apply it to our spatial transcriptomic datasets.

---

# Hands-on component 4

Our in-class hands-on component will involve analyzing either the MERFISH or Visium dataset using principal components analysis to create a data visualization.

# Homework Assignment 4

Make a new data visualization of either the MERFISH or Visium dataset using ggplot in R (do not make the same visualizations that were made in class). Write a description of what you did using vocabulary terms from Lesson 1. See slides for more details on what is expected and how to submit your homework.

Make a pull request to submit your homework (due Saturday Midnight).

Please also install the [`Rtsne` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rtsne/index.html) by running in `R` the command `install.packages('Rtsne')` for the hands-on component of the next class.
